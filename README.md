# Darwin Evolution MT5

Darwin Evolution MT5 is an expert advisor designed to automate trading on the MetaTrader 5 platform. It is developed by Forex Robot Easy Team and aims to provide traders with an efficient and reliable tool for executing trades based on predefined entry criteria and market analysis.

## Features

- Market analysis: The expert advisor utilizes various indicators and parameters to perform market analysis and identify potential trade opportunities.

- Risk management: The risk management feature allows traders to set the risk percentage for position sizing, as well as stop loss and take profit levels.

## How it Works

The expert advisor operates based on a series of functions that are executed during different stages of the trading process. Here is an overview of its workflow:

1. **Initialization** (OnInit): In this stage, the necessary indicators and parameters for market analysis are set up. Traders can customize the default settings, such as the period for market analysis and risk percentage.

2. **Trade Execution** (OnTick): This function is called on every tick, and it checks if there is a trade opportunity based on the predefined entry criteria. If a trade opportunity is identified, the expert advisor executes the trade by calculating the position size, determining the entry price, and placing the trade with the appropriate order type and parameters.

3. **Position Management** (ManagePositions): This function is responsible for managing open positions. It allows traders to modify stop loss and take profit levels for open positions and close positions that meet certain criteria.

4. **Performance Monitoring** (MonitorPerformance): This function calculates and tracks key performance metrics, such as profit/loss, win/loss ratio, and drawdown. Traders can use this information to evaluate the performance of their trading strategy.
